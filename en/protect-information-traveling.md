If you are a journalist, a activist or a human right defenders, you may be the subject of surveillance while traveling. A few precautions are necessary.

<!--more-->

## Before you leave

  * **Back up and clean your data** before you go, both on your phone and on your computer. Better still, leave with a computer that is completely empty of all personal information.
  * **Install all updates**. Do not make any updates once there, whether for your computer or your smartphone.
  * **Encrypt the contents of&nbsp;your computer and your smartphone** (internal memory and SD card). In case of theft, your data will be unusable. Encryption is enabled by default on iPhones since iOS 8, and on Android phones since Android 6 « Marshmallow ».
  * **Secure your social networking accounts** with strong passwords at least 20 characters long. Think « passphrase ». Example: « I read a very good book tonight.”
  * **Use two-step verification**, which consists of receiving a code on your phone before you can access a service.
  * **Make sure that your firewall** is enabled on your computer.
  * **Install an antivirus program.**

## Once there

  * **Always lock your session** on your **computer** and on your smartphone.
  * **Beware of prying eyes**; use a privacy filter.
  * **Do not leave your devices in your room.** Always bring them with you. Once in the hands of an expert, no protection will guarantee that you have not been infected by a virus.
  * **Never connect to public wifi without protection**. [Use a VPN](https://nothing2hide.org/wiki/doku.php?id=en:protectionnumerique:vpn). This tool routes your internet traffic through an encrypted tunnel and protects it from any prying eyes. (Nothing2hide provides VPNs.)
  * **Use secure communication applications** to encrypt your messages and phone calls—e.g., Signal, WhatsApp, Wire.

## Returning home

  * **Ask your IT manager or an expert you know to examine** your computer and smartphone.
  * **If you experience abnormal behavior on any of your devices**, including unintentional rebooting, abnormal battery usage, etc., reset them.
