Tools for all

We publish and aggregate teaching sheets to facilitate "turnkey" workshops around two themes: Data in the Internet time and information on the Internet. We invite you to use these teaching sheets to facilitate workshops and conferences within your association, your school, your library. These sheets are published - like all the content produced by the association - under a creative commons license and are freely reusable and editable. Do not hesitate!
