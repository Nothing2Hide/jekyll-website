Tools for all
--------------

We publish and aggregate teaching sheets to facilitate "turnkey" workshops around two themes: Data in the Internet time and information on the Internet. We invite you to use these teaching sheets to facilitate workshops and conferences within your association, your school, your library. These sheets are published - like all the content produced by the association - under a creative commons license and are freely reusable and editable. Do not hesitate!

Workshops and conferences
-------------------------

Nothing2Hide hosts and participates in digital literacy events. We regularly intervene in media libraries or schools to lead debates and workshops on false information, personal data and data protection. All our conference materials are available online.
