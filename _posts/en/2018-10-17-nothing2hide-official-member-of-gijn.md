We are particularly proud to announce that Nothing2Hide is now a member organization of the Global Investigative Journalist Network (GIJN).

<!--more-->

[The Global Investigative Journalism Network](https://gijn.org) is an international association of journalism organizations that support the training and sharing of information among investigative and data journalists—even in repressive regimes and marginalized communities.

The protection and promotion of a free and independent information is at the heart of our action. This is why we are delighted to [join a network of organization](https://gijn.org/2018/10/17/gijn-welcomes-10-new-member-groups-from-9-countries/) sharing the same goals.

## Investigation at the heart of our action

Since 2017 we have trained **more than 300 journalists** and activists **in 6 countries** : France, Sweden, Indonesia, Burkina Faso, [Turkey](https://nothing2hide.org/en/2018/08/27/nothing2hide-and-souriatna/) and Tanzania. We provide advanced censorship circumvention tools and stealth hosting services for journalists and Human Right Defenders. We launched a [whistle blowing platform](https://nothing2hide.org/fr/2018/10/01/lanceurs-dalerte-la-plateforme-dalerte-locales-securisees/) in partnership with the French media Médiacités and Goleaks.

We contribute on a regular basis to events involving Human Rights, journalism and technology :

  * the Oslo Freedom Forum where we met and trained activists, 
  * [« Les assises du journalisme »](https://nothing2hide.org/fr/2018/03/13/nothing2hide-aux-assises-du-journalisme-les-14-15-et-16-mars/), one of the most important event for journalists in France, where we ran workshops on digital safety
  * [the Toulouse Hacker Space festival](https://nothing2hide.org/fr/2018/05/07/thsf/) (the biggest hacker event in France) where we run workshops on Fake news, information manipulation and how to avoid it
  * We&rsquo;ll be in on the 27th October in London, invited by the Mozila foundation, to run a workshop at the MozFest on [open source investigation for citizen](https://guidebook.com/guide/147793/event/21682644/)
